This project is a timer uses buttons that the user can click to start the timer. The timer can also be paused or canceled, and right-clicking the buttons will delete them. You can add your own times in a form.

I added a stopwatch in the recent update, which can also be paused or canceled. I spent almost five hours adding an upload sound feature, but I ended up giving up because it didn't really actually offer that much to the website. I also added 5 different themes to choose from.

As this is my first website in a year and my first project on my own, I spent a lot of extra time on this. If I were to start and remake this from scratch, I would probably only take like 3 or 4 hours...
